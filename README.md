### Notes
This part of the development was fairly simple. I have been having problems doing the second bonus feature, where I access another part of the API via a web view, as the webview never shows up. Additionally, I have been having problems with this submission and last where I cannot embed the GIF in the README file.

### Notes
There weren't many challenges I ran into while completing this portion of the application's development. I learned a lot, given I had no knowledge of CocoaPods or API's and it took me a decent amount of time to figure out the command line instructions as I don't use terminal very often.
